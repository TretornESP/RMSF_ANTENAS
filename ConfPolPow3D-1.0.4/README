DESCRIPTION

ConfPolPow3D is tool with a GUI prepared to show the positions, 
amplitude/phase distributions and the polar power patterns (3D and 2D,
specifying total field, and its both theta and phi components) 
generated by a conformal antenna.

The relative excitation amplitude of each element is plotted 
with an orientation along the local Z axis of such an element.
           
The way the program works is explained clearly with plenty of 
comments added practically before each line of the source code.
